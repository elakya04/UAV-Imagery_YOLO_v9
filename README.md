Region-Aware Attention Augmentation for Object Detection in UAV Imagery
Object detection in images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains a significant problem in the field of computer vision, largely because of intrinsic limitations like low spatial resolution, cluttered backgrounds, occlusions, and extreme scale and viewpoint variations. Classical data augmentation techniques pose uniform transformations to the whole image, which tends to ignore or disrupt tiny, but essential areas where objects of interest lie. Consequently, these methods do not effectively mimic the intricacies of actual UAV scenarios, restricting detection model generalization abilities. To tackle this, we introduce an attention-enabled data augmentation pipeline specific to YOLO-based models through the use of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to improve model robustness and generalization. Our approach utilizes a special Grad-CAM implementation to create attention maps from one of the YOLOv9 model's intermediate layers, highlighting areas of high relevance. These areas are selectively augmented with targeted transformations—such as noise injection, blurring, color shifting, and contrast modification —instead of applying global augmentations. This model-guided approach focuses training efforts on the areas the network perceives as salient, effectively strengthening key visual cues. The pipeline is visual and modular, enabling side-by-side output of original images, attention maps, and augmented results. Experimental findings indicate that fine-tuning the YOLO models using this attention-based augmentation drastically decreases the loss in early stage of training and thus improving the accuracy on validation set by 6% and on test set by 5% indicating its capability to identify small objects in demanding UAV settings, and hence representing an emerging solution for real-world applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster recovery.
